HW2 Notes:

Problems Encountered: I didn't encounter any issues with writing the code. 
I've switched over to VScode from Visual studio, and I find the lightweight 
enviroment to be easier to work with.

Confidence level - 10 throughout all the questions. My only question is that I am assuming
that you would like us to not use loops yet, and I couldn't figure out a more efficent
way to get the lowest and highest value from question 1 without including loops.
