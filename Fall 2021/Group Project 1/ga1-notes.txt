Problem 1:

	Chase Condron:
    a.) How do you think C++ is different from C?
        C++ is different from C in the way that C++ adds classes and object-oriented programming. As well as having better security 
        over C in how you can hide variables that were once visible in C.

    b.) Where do you think C++ is widely used?

        C++ is mainly used in operating systems or software that is built to be fast and efficient. It also has popularity in
        gaming software and databases.

    c.) What is currently the latest stable release of C++, and what is the latest preview release of C++? What is the next release of C++ expected to be?

        The current stable release of C++ is C++20, and the latest preview of C++ is C++23. I would assume the next release of C++ to be within the next 3 to 4 years from
        C++'s original release date. So, about 2024 or 2023.

    d.) What motivated Stroustroup to start working on this new C++ language?

        He had been using Simula and that it had features that were very helpful  for large software development, but the language itself was too slow
        and impractical for use. C was chosen as the basis for C++ development because it was general purpose, fast, portable and widely used.

    e.) Why did he call it C++?

        The name comes from C++'s own operator, being ++, which increments the value of a variable, and a common naming convention of using
        + to indicate an enhanced computer program. The language had been named 'new C' and 'C with classes' before finally
        becoming C++.

    f.) The Wikipedia page lists about 11 principles/philosophy behind C++. Comment on one or more of these principles, whether you have experienced them in C++ or with other programming languages, 
        and what your opinion about that principle is.

        I like that there should be no language beneath C++ with given the exception to assembly language. This is great as you can make very efficient code with C++ as its a low level language.
        Every feature should be implementable. With this idea, it allows C++ to be extremely flexible in terms of what C++ is limited to.

    g.) Look at some of the criticism of C++. Comment on one or more of these criticisms based on your experience/expectations.

        With my current knowledge of C++, C++ does have a lot of excessive code that other languages can cut shorter.
        It's lacking in terms of garbage collection and the errors that C++ can throw at you can be rather vague and long
        A new up and coming language that seems interesting is Rust. Which is basically C++, however
        with better safety standard which I can agree with. However C++ still has the better performance.

    e.) Please add anything more about C++, or about computer programming in general, that you would like to share.

        The reason why C++ is so successful is how it is able to implement many different programming styles.

Individual Comments:

    Chase Condron: 
    With Q2 I had no trouble getting all positive values, however once I tried to enter negative values is where I got into issues. I thought I could solve this simply by giving currSecLargest = x-1;
    However, this results in a bug that I didn't see. Eventually I got to the solution of storing the first two inputs before the loop begins, thanks to help from the professor.
